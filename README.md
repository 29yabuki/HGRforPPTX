# HGR for Powerpoint

This implementation makes use of the hand gesture recognition of [Kazuhito00](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe) using mediapipe.

# Usage

There are three states:
- To stay still put your right hand in the middle in a neutral stance.
- To go one slide forward, swipe your right hand to your left.
- To go one slide back, swipe your right hand to your right.

After doing a forward or back, there will be 3 seconds cooldown.
